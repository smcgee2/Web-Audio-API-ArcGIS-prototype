# Web-Audio-API-ArcGIS-prototype
Exploring creating 3D audio with a 3D map (WIP)

The idea for this application is to showcase 3D audio in 3D space. The ArcGIS platform has a lot of data that we can help harness to hopefully make the process of adding in audio clips easier. 

Stage 1.
Showcase it working with a small prototype with 1 or 2 prebaked audio clips.

Stage 2.
Automate with another external API to get sound effects.
